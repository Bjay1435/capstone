REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 bram_image/ram_reg_0_0 has an input control pin bram_image/ram_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[0] (net: bram_image/w_addr[0]) which is driven by a register (memState_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

The RAMB36E1 bram_int_lo/ram_reg_0_15 has an input control pin bram_int_lo/ram_reg_0_15/ADDRARDADDR[8] (net: bram_int_lo/reg_addr_reg[14]_rep[8]) which is driven by a register (memState_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

The RAMB36E1 bram_int_lo/ram_reg_0_5 has an input control pin bram_int_lo/ram_reg_0_5/ADDRARDADDR[0] (net: bram_int_lo/ADDRARDADDR[0]) which is driven by a register (feature_pipeline/cm/FP1/reg_addr_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

The RAMB36E1 bram_int_lo/ram_reg_1_2 has an input control pin bram_int_lo/ram_reg_1_2/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: bram_int_lo/ADDRARDADDR[13]) which is driven by a register (memState_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

The RAMB36E1 bram_int_lo/ram_reg_1_6 has an input control pin bram_int_lo/ram_reg_1_6/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: bram_int_lo/ADDRARDADDR[13]) which is driven by a register (memState_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
